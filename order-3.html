<div class="row h-100 px-2 py-7 row-bground3" aria-label="The background of this image consists of a plain, modern kitchen you would see in a restaurant. The typeface used across the website is roboto which is a plain and readable san serif font. The top half of the screen consists of the title of the website and the receipt bar under it. At the top of the page in black, bold letters is the title  “How to make the Perfect Grilled Cheese by Kris”. Just under that is a grey receipt holder (commonly used by line chefs in restaurants to help keep track of orders) that extends the length of the website. The accordion menu to the right of “Order #3” called “Tips” will make another order receipt appear which will elaborate on specific parts of the recipe for inexperienced chefs. On the right side of the receipt holder is an order that lists the copyright and author of the website. In the middle of the website is a hanger rack holding a cheese knife, a spatula and a cheese grater. Near this is the grilled cheese beginning to soar through the air from the pan to the small white plate. In the bottom left corner of the background there is a pan at a slight angle (from launching the grilled cheese) which is on top of a plain grey hob with five, numbered knobs (from left to right the hobs count from one to five) with each knob representing a different page number.  Above the pan is a speech bubble with the phrase “Need to go back a step, chef?” which is clickable and takes you to “Order #2”. In the bottom right corner of the background there is a small white plate resting on a plain, white acrylic countertop. Above the plate is a speech bubble with the phrase “Ready to take your next order, Chef?” which is clickable and takes you to “Order #4”.">

The first method is recommended for less experienced chefs as it gives ye less risk of burning yourself while the second method gives you greater control of making the grilled cheese as ye’re taking ye time to place everything in its perfect position!
